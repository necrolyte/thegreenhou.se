<b><font size='+3'>Deployment</font></b><br><br>
Our initial designs would require a simple deployment into the atmosphere. On deployment from the
intial rocket/propolusion system, 'TheGreenhou.se' would enter the atmosphere, deploy parachutes, and soft
land onto the surface. As it enters the atmosphere, one option would be to open louvers as intake vales, with the
high velocity entry, collect pressurized atmosphere for use in inflating 'TheGreenhou.se'.
<br><br>
On landing, we check to make sure that we landed correctly and not upside down. If upside down, we inflate a specific way
to self right the entire structure. 'TheGreenhou.se' would self-inflate using the captured atmosphere on entry, or by having an on-board compressor to
bring in the atmosphere (95% CO2). One other method would be our origami style structure that would spin on its floor to engage and push the walls itself
Please see more information under the designs tab above on structure analysis.

Once the structure is fully deployed, the interior atmosphere is created by pulling in external atmosphere and separating into Carbon Dioxide, Oxygen, Nitrogen
and mixing these separated gasses with the on-board Hydrogen tank to create a new ratio that would simulate Earth's atmosphere.
<br><br>
By bringing a type of nuclear power source and the nano power technology, we would be able to either power internal heaters or pull heat from the nuclear source,
and by able to regulate environment, temperature, humidity, and pressure.
<br><br>
Plants are pre-planted in growth media (cotton or hemp), and once atmosphere is created and temperature is controlled, watering of plants can be commenced to start
the growth process. The planting surface is raised from the ground level to allow plants that grow underground (Carrots, Potatoes, Etc) to be harvested easily by an automated
system under the tables.<br>
