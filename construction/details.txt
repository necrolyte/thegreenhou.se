Water Bladder
Dome Construction
Living Quarters in front half (o2 environment)
Mid-Section is greenhouse
Rear-Section is water/o2 storage tanks
Crop is already planted in media on 'Growing Platform'


Starts by being vacuum packed into container
    On deploying/landing -
        Structure self-inflates
          Onboard pressurized tanks
          External compressor with atmosphere input

        Growing Platform Folds down
        Plumbing folds down
        Internal Atmosphere is created by bringing in external co2
          Possible conversion to o2
          Onboard Nitrogen tank?

          Seperate gasses on input to store Oxygen, CO2, Nitrogen, Argon
          Store each gas separately and then combine them in the greenhouse area to match Earth's Atmosphere
