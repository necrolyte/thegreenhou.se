A collection of ideas generated at theClubhou.se in Augusta, GA for a Deployable Greenhouse on Earth or Mars.

Please view the different files to see possible solutions of crops, design ideas, and more.

We are working on methods to improve atmospheric conditions in a confined space to help grow
multiple species of plants. Using artificial lighting, minimal on-board water, a self harvesting
system, and possible living quarters once fully deployed.



Possible Crops
===========================
Potatoes
Soybeans
Carrots
Alge



Artifical Lighting
===========================
LEDs of multiple colors
UV Stabilizing?



Deployable Structure
===========================
By creating a 'lay flat' structure, it would be easily folded and stowed in cargo bay.



Atmosphere Conditioning
===========================
Bringing atmosphere in from outside the structure, going through a gas separation system to contain
CO2, N, Ar, and possibly bringing our own source of H to stabilize the internal atmosphere to 'Earth-like'
conditions for growing/living.
